# TF-IDF - Term frequency-inverse document frequency implmentation

Tf-idf stands for _term frequency-inverse document frequency_, and the tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query.

One of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf-idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.

Tf-idf can be successfully used for stop-words filtering in various subject fields including text summarization and classification.

This module is implmented in Python.
